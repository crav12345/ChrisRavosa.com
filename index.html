        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Christopher Ravosa, a software engineer with a passion for
          developing robust, elegant, scalable code. I enjoy the complexities of
          full-stack development on distributed systems and have experience with
          mobile apps, web apps, video games, RESTful API servers, matchmaking
          servers, SQL and NoSQL databases, cloud computing, and continuous
          integration/continuous deployment. I hope you'll explore some of my
          professional projects listed here and some of my side projects listed
          on my GitHub, linked in the footer of this page.
